hashi.sh - Key/Value Store for Bash
===================================

Really?

Well, no, not technically. Bash doesn't support hashes natively. So, we fake it via
obfuscated and escaped environment variables. For really simple use cases, it's almost
good enough. On the plus-side, it's also fast.

Why would I use this?

You probably wouldn't. I use it to load snippets of text into the shell for frequent and
fast programmatic access.

This is public-domain software. Use at your own risk.

Enjoy.
