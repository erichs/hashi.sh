## Credits

### Test Framework

Inspiration for the simple test framework comes from Gary Bernhardt, and his excellent [Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog) Screencasts.

### Syntax and Function Composition

Inspiration (and occasionally implementation) for some of the syntax and functions used in hashi.sh comes from [remi Taylor's shash project](https://github.com/remi/shash)
